<p>Dear, <br><br>
    I am Amel Smajic, second-year  IPI-Academy student.<br>
    I started studying programming in the 9th grade of elementary school.<br>
    I went to the Electrotechnical High School in Tuzla, where I started studying computer science.  <br>
    After that I enrolled into IPI because it has a good reputation and has a lot of ex-students employed in IT sector.  <br><br>

    In my past, I did a lot of small projects, alone and in groups. <br>
    Most of them are on my Git account and can be seen. <br><br>

    I would like to point out few of my best projects:<br>
    <ul>
        <li> my personal web page(HTML,CSS,PHP),</li><br>
        <li> platformer game(C#,VS),</li><br>
        <li> Cooking timer- maturski (C embedded),</li><br>
        <li> IQ raiser platform and final IPI-projects (Collection of final projects in college, till now).</li><br>
    </ul>
    I have good knowledge in HTML and CSS, JS, SQL, PHP, and not long ago I started learning Go-lang too.<br> 
    As for the rest I learned C,C++ and C# during my studies.   <br><br>

    I enjoy in the development process of my apps and it is always extremely rewarding to see the product of your hard work.<br>
    I still have a lot to learn and as for right now, all I ask for is a chance to prove myself and my skills.  <br><br>
    Thank you for this opportunity and I hope that I am up to your standards.<br>

    <br><br><br>

    Best regards.
</p>
